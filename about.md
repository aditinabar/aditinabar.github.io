Hey, thanks for dropping by! My name’s Aditi, I’m a machine learning engineer with 7 years of experience in Machine Learning, Data Engineering and ML Ops, and general backend development.

A TLDR of my machine learning and engineering experience:
- I've led a cross-functional effort and designed a system to support internal cross-sell lead generation.
- I trained a siamese LSTM to produce a sentence-embedding similarity measure based on which sales can broker sales deals.
- I built a Multi-Task Learning model to train on a number of tasks, and predict on tasks including transaction categorization and user behavior prediction.
- I have leadership experience from mentoring an intern, and leading a team of 4 engineers with system design and project scoping.

Some things about me: 
- I love engineering, and technology, and the value it can add to people’s lives, but I also value my time outside the office.
- I have a cactus collection that has officially taken over my patio.
- I play tennis (#takethislob), my team made it to sectionals two seasons in a row. As much as we try not to take it too seriously, I'm really proud of our hard work.
