Hey, thanks for dropping by! My name’s Aditi, I’m a machine learning engineer with a broad range of ML experience, strong leadership skills, and a passion for using ML and engineering to tackle business problems. I have years of experience in machine learning, ML Ops, and general backend development, as well as building systems that employ each of those facets. The ways in which engineering and technology can add value to people's lives is exciting, and is why I love doing the work I do. Outside of work, I play tennis and have a pretty cool cactus collection.
