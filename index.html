My name is Aditi Nabar and I currently work as a Data Engineer at an energy forecasting company. I have a year of experience working as a Data Scientist and about two years working as a Data Engineer.
<br>
<br>
Before my first role as a Data Scientist, I received a masters degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Houston. Since then I've continued my study of modeling techniques using Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn and Intro to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang as refreshers, and Sebastian Raschka's resources on his website as a reference text.

<br>
When I'm not programming, you can find me studying math, baking, or hanging out with my succulents.
